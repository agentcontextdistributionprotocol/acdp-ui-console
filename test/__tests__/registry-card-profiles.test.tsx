// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The profile chips an operator actually sees on /registries (#95).
//
// `mock-data.test.ts` pins the DATA — that no demo registry advertises a
// profile a real one would refuse to boot with. That says nothing about the
// render, and the render is where the second half of #95 lives: two entries in
// `PROFILE_INFO` existed solely to describe the two invalid ids. Tooltip copy
// for an id nothing emits is unreachable text, and worse than unreachable — it
// ratified both ids for the next person who read the file looking for what a
// profile id is supposed to look like.
//
// So these tests are about the fallback as much as the happy path. Deleting the
// two entries is only safe if an id with NO entry still renders its own text,
// which is the assertion that makes the deletion a non-event rather than a
// regression waiting for a future profile.
//
// WHY THIS FILE ASSERTS ON `title`, against CLAUDE.md's rule. The rule — "assert
// on rendered text, never on a `title` tooltip" — exists because a trust
// surface that discloses only on hover is invisible to touch, to the keyboard
// and to a screen reader, so it is not disclosing. Nothing here is a trust
// verdict: the chip's own TEXT is the profile id, which is the fact, and the
// tooltip is a gloss on it. What is asserted is that the gloss exists and is
// reachable for every advertisable id — the opposite failure from the one the
// rule guards. The tooltip predates this change; whether it should be a tooltip
// at all is a separate question, and it is filed rather than settled here.
